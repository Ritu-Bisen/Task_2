# Overview of the project
## Project : Student Grade Tracker Using Java <br/>
### Objective

The objective of this project is to perform student grade tracker.<br/>
Creating a student grade tracker in Java involves developing a program that allows users to manage and monitor student grades. 
The application typically supports features such as adding student records, inputting grades, calculating average grades, and displaying performance summaries.
Here's a high-level overview of how to build such a tracker:

# Setup Development Environment:

Initialize a new Java project and create a main class, e.g., StudentGradeTracker.

# Define Data Structures:
Use classes to represent students and their grades. For example, a Student class might contain attributes such as name and a list of grades.

# Input and Storage:

Implement methods to add new students and input their grades. Utilize data structures such as arrays or ArrayList to store this information.
